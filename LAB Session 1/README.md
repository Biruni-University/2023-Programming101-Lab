# SESSION 1

## Exercise 1

Maya recently registered to work as a developer but she has some
problems with Java.

Help her to create her first Java program that contains 3 slots that can
save information in memory in types of "natural numbers", "single
Alphabet character", "A sentences"

## Exercise 2

Maya created this program but the program is not working. Help her to
fix the errors and show the output of the program.

``` java
public class Main {
    private int void main(String[] args) {
        system.in.println("12 + 13 + 15") // 12 + 13 + 15 = 40
    }
}


```

## Exercise 3

Maya Wants to show her friends the new thing that she learnt in the
programming. help her to print this statement using escape characters.

``` bash
   *
  ***
 *****
*******
  | | 
```

## Exercise 4

Maya loves math and she found out that if you think of any number then
double the number, add 9 to the result, subtract 3 with the result,
divide the result by 2, subtract the first number started with, the
answer is always 3!

X -&gt; 2X -&gt; 2X+9 -&gt; (2X+9) - 3 -&gt; ((2X+9) -3)/2 -&gt;
(((2X+9) -3)/2)-X = 3

She wants to show this as some print statements to her friends and made
them think that's an AI doing that!

Use your imagination and write a program that can make the Maya's friend
that the algorithm that she found is an AI program, but in fact it's
just a few print statement!
